Lane detection is a vital application of environmental perception, which utilizes cameras or LIDAR to identify lane lines or lane areas. In recent years, remarkable advancements have been made in detecting accuracy. We are aiming to provide a comprehensive review of vision-based lane detection techniques. The paper starts by presenting the background of lane detection, including traditional methods and deep learning-based approaches. The existing lane detection methods are categorized into two categories: two-step and one-step methods. The paper also discusses various network architectures, such as classification and object detection-based methods, end-to-end image-segmentation based techniques, and optimization strategies. Moreover, the paper provides insights into related loss functions for each method, along with their strengths and limitations. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to present a comprehensive review of vision-based lane detection methods.
